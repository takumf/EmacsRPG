# Emacs for Role Playing Games #

There will be nothing fancy here. Mostly some tutorials and small Elisp scripts that can be used to improve more crunchy parts of the game.

This repository will be dedicated as a collection of by contributions for r/rpgprograms at reddit.com

Currently under development:

* Org tutorial
* Elisp tutorial
* oWoD and Basic D20 toolboxes.
