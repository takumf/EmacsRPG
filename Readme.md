# Emacs for Role Playing Games #

There will be nothing fancy here. Mostly some tutorials and small Elisp scripts that can be used to improve more crunchy parts of the game.

This repository will be dedicated as a collection of by contributions for r/rpgprograms at reddit.com

Currently under development:

* Org tutorial
* Elisp tutorial
* oWoD and Basic D20 toolboxes.

There are few reservations regarding .org files:

* Open them in your own Emacs! YOu can then generate any other output. Basic one on github is quite ugly.
* Look at the source of each file by selecting 'raw' at the upper margin of the preview.
* Experiment with them and remember that they are just templates.
